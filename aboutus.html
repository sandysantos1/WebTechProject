<p>Hi, my name is Sandy Santos and I am the creator of this website. 
    I am originally from Houston, Texas but my family background is Latin American. 
    Both my parents were born and raised in El Salvador. They've told me many stories of their
    times back at home, but something that always stuck to me was the times they talked about how good the coffee is. 
    My dad has told me stories of when he would work in these plantations picking coffee beans and whole process of how they 
    are made. When I get the chance to visit my parents home country it's an amazing experience every time. Visiting gave
    me a chance of seeing the actual coffee plantations. When seeing the acres of land filled a thought always popped into my head.
    Why isn't Salvadorean coffee beans more popular?
